A device identifier may be data stored in connection with the device hardware, data stored in connection with the device's operating system or other software, or data sent to the device by Carrot Path. A device identifier may deliver information to us or to a third-party partner about how you browse and use our Service and may help us or others provide reports or targeted content and ads on our Service. Some features of our Service may not function properly of as well if use or availability of device identifiers is impaired or disabled.</li>
          <li>Metadata: Metadata is essentially technical data about User Content. For example, metadata can describe when a picture of an event uploaded by a Carrot Path user was collected and how that picture is formatted.</li>
